# CIS18A Project
The Swirled Spoon project is an interactive Java-based ordering system designed to simulate an online fine dining experience focused on premium yogurt swirls. We accept orders from 1 pm - 9 pm and close delivery at 6 pm with a $5 charge! The program allows users to browse through a menu of unique swirl flavors, place customized orders, and choose between delivery or in-person pickup options.
